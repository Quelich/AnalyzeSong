It doesn't feel like how it used to
but still I tell myself it is
Maybe I've got myself used to
so used to us

Wishing I could give you a reason
but it wont make a difference
Wishing I could solve all the pieces
but I don't know how

'Cause I still miss you when you're out
and we'll laying on the couch, 
in the morning there's no doubt
but at times I forget our moments
when we're staying up all night
laugh until we lose our minds
and I'm recalling every problem
and at times I forget our moments

Because I don't always recall
And at times I forget our moments

Seems like I'm picking us apart now
trying to separate our flaws
Nothing is perfect when it falls down
Did I give up?

Wishing I could give you a reason
but it wont make a difference
Wishing I could solve all the pieces
but I don't know how

'Cause I still miss you when you're out
and we'll laying on the couch, 
in the morning there's no doubt
but at times I forget our moments
when we're staying up all night
laugh until we lose our minds
and I'm recalling every problem
and at times I forget our moments

Because I don't always recall
And at times I forget our moments
